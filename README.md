# cs-maps-tree-map-lab

## Learning goals

1.  Implement the `Map` interface using a binary search tree.
2.  Analyze the performance of a tree-backed map.


## Overview

At this point you should be familiar with the `Map` interface and the `HashMap` implementation provided by Java.  And by making your own `Map` using a hash table, you should understand how `HashMap` works and why we expect its core methods to be constant time.

Because of this performance, `HashMap` is widely used, but it is not the only implementation of `Map`.  There are two reasons you might want another implementation:

1.  Hashing can be slow, so even though `HashMap` operations are constant time, the "constant" might be big.

2.  The keys in a hash table are not stored in any particular order; in fact, the order might change when the table grows and the keys are rehashed.  For some applications, it is necessary, or at least useful, to keep the keys in order.

It turns out to be hard to solve both of these problems at the same time, but Java provides an implementation called `TreeMap` that comes close:

1.  The order of growth is not quite as good.  Instead of constant time, a `TreeMap` takes time proportional to `log n`.

2.  Inside the `TreeMap`, the keys are not stored in order; they are stored in a **binary search tree**, which makes it possible to traverse the keys, in order, in linear time.

In this lab, we'll explain how binary search trees work and then you will use one to implement a `Map`.  Along the way, we'll analyze the performance of the core map methods when implemented using a tree.


## Binary search tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a tree where each node contains a key, and every `node` has the "BST property":

1.  If `node` has a left child, all keys in the left subtree must be less than the key in `node`.
2.  If `node` has a right child, all keys in the right subtree must be greater than the key in `node`.

The following diagram shows a tree of integers that has this property.

This figure is from the [Wikipedia page on binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), which you might find useful while you work on this lab.

The key in the root is 8, and you can confirm that all keys to the left of the root are less than 8, and all keys to the right are greater.  You can also check that the other nodes have this property.

Looking up a key in a binary search tree is fast because we don't have to search the entire tree.  Starting at the root, we can use the following algorithm:

1.  Compare the key you are looking for, `target`, to the key in the current node.  If they are equal, you are done.

2.  If `target` is less than the current key, search the left tree.  If there isn't one, `target` is not in the tree.

3.  If `target` is greater than the current key, search the right tree.  If there isn't one, `target` is not in the tree.

At each level of the tree, you only have to search one child.  For example, if you look for `target = 4` in the previous diagram, you start at the root, which contains the key `8`.  Because `target` is less than `8`, you go left.  Because `target` is greater than `3` you go right.  Because `target` is less than `6`, you go left.  And then you find the key you are looking for.

In this example, it takes `4` comparisons to find the target, even though the tree contains 9 keys.  In general, the number of comparisons is proportional to the height of the tree, not the number of keys in the tree.

So what can we say about the relationship between the height of the tree, `h`, and the number of nodes, `n`?  Starting small and working up:

*  If `h=1`, the tree only contains one node, so `n=1`.

*  If `h=2`, we can add two more nodes, for a total of `n=3`.

*  If `h=3`, we can add up to `4` more nodes, for a total of `n=7`.

*  If `h=4`, we can add up to `8` more nodes, for a total of `n=15`.

By now you might see the pattern.  If we number the levels tree from `1` to `h`, the level with index `i` can have up to 2<sup>i-1</sup> nodes.  And the total number of nodes in `h` levels is 2<sup>h</sup>-1.  If we have

n = 2<sup>h</sup> - 1

We can take the log base 2 of both sides:

log<sub>2</sub> â‰ˆ h

Which means that the height of the tree is proportional to `log n`, if the tree is full; that is, if each level contains the maximum number of nodes.

So we expect that we can look up a key in a binary search tree in time proportional to `log n`.  This is true if the tree is full, and even if the tree is only partially full.  But it is not always true, as we will see.

An algorithm that takes time proportional to `log n` is called "logarithmic" or "log time", and it belongs to the order of growth O(`log n`).


## Implementing a tree-backed `Map`

In this section we'll describe the starter code for this lab; in the next section we'll give you instructions for filling in the missing methods.

Here's the beginning of our implementation, called `MyTreeMap`:

```java
public class MyTreeMap<K, V> implements Map<K, V> {

	private int size = 0;
	private Node root = null;
```

The instance variables are `size`, which keeps track of the number of keys, and `root`, which is a reference to the root node in the tree.  When the tree is empty, `root` is `null` and `size` is 0.

Here's the definition of `Node`, which is defined inside `MyTreeMap`:

```java
	protected class Node {
		public K key;
		public V value;
		public Node left = null;
		public Node right = null;

		public Node(K key, V value) {
			this.key = key;
			this.value = value;
		}
	}
```

Each node contains a key-value pair and references to two child nodes, `left` and `right`.  Either or both of the child nodes can be `null`.

Some of the `Map` methods are easy to implement, like `size` and `clear`:

```java
	public int size() {
		return size;
	}

	public void clear() {
		size = 0;
		root = null;
	}
```

`size` is clearly constant time.

`clear` appears to be constant time, but consider this: when `root` is set to `null`, the garbage collector reclaims the nodes in the tree, which takes linear time.  Should work done by the garbage collector count?  We think so.

In the next section, you'll fill in some of the other methods, including the most important ones, `get` and `put`.


## Instructions

When you check out the repository for this lab, you should find a file structure similar to what you saw in previous labs.  The top level directory contains `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `README.md`, and the directory with the code for this lab, `javacs-lab09`.

In the subdirectory `javacs-lab09/src/com/flatironschool/javacs` you'll find these source files:

*  `MyTreeMap.java` contains the code from the previous section with outlines for the missing methods.

*  `MyTreeMapTest.java` contains the unit tests for `MyTreeMap`.

Also, in `javacs-lab09`, you'll find the Ant build file `build.xml`.

*  In `javacs-lab09`, run `ant build` to compile the source files.  Then run `ant test`, which runs `MyTreeMapTest`.  Several tests should fail, because you have some work to do!

*  We've provided outlines for `get` and `containsKey`.  Both of them use `findNode`, which is a private method we defined; it is not part of the `Map` interface.  Here's how it starts:

```java
	private Node findNode(Object target) {
		if (target == null) {
			throw new NullPointerException();
		}

		@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
		Comparable<? super K> k = (Comparable<? super K>) target;
		int cmp = k.compareTo(p.key);
		// TODO: Fill this in.
		return null;
	}
```

The parameter `target` is the key we're looking for.  If `target` is `null`, `findNode` throws an exception.  Some implementations of `Map` can handle `null` as a key, but in a binary search tree, we need to be able to compare keys, so dealing with `null` is problematic.  To keep things simple, we decided that our implementation should not allow `null` as a key.

The next lines show how we can compare `target` to a key in the tree.  From the signature of `get` and `containsKey`, the compiler considers `target` to be an `Object`.  But we need to be able to compare keys, so we typecast `target` to `Comparable<? super K>`, which means that it is comparable to an instance of type `K`, or any superclass of `K`.  
If you are not familiar with this use of "type wildcards", [you can read more here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/morefun.html).

Fortunately, dealing with Java's type system is not the point of this exercise.  Your job is to fill in the rest of `findNode`.  If it finds a node that contains `target` as a key, it should return the node.  Otherwise it should return `null`.  When you get this working, the tests for `get` and `containsKey` should pass.

Note that your solution should only search one path through the tree, so it should take time proportional to the height of the tree.  You should not search the whole tree!

*  Your next task is to fill in `containsValue`.  To get you started, we've provided a helper method, `equals`, that compares `target` and a given key.  Note that the values in the tree (as opposed to the keys) are not necessarily comparable, so we can't use `compareTo`; we have to invoke `equals` on `target`.

Unlike your previous solution for `findNode`, your solution for `containsValue` *does* have to search the whole tree, so its runtime will proportional to the number of keys, `n`, not the height of the tree, `h`.

*  The next method you should fill in is `put`.  We've provided starter code that handles the simple cases:

```java
	public V put(K key, V value) {
		if (key == null) {
			throw new NullPointerException();
		}
		if (root == null) {
			root = new Node(key, value);
			size++;
			return null;
		}
		return putHelper(root, key, value);
	}

	private V putHelper(Node node, K key, V value) {
		// TODO: Fill this in.
	}
```

If you try to put `null` as a key, `put` throws an exception.

If the tree is empty, `put` creates a new node and initializes the instance variable `root`.

Otherwise, it calls `putHelper`, which is a private method we defined; it is not part of the `Map` interface.

Fill in `putHelper` so it searches the tree and:

1.  If `key` is already in the tree, it replaces the old value with the new, and returns the old value.

2.  If `key` is not in the tree, it creates a new node, finds the right place to add it, and returns `null`.

Your implementation of `put` should take time proportional to `h`, not `n`.  Ideally you should search the tree only once, but if you find it easier to search twice, you can do that; it will be slower, but it doesn't change the order of growth.

*  Finally, you should fill in the body of `keySet`.  [According to the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html#keySet()), this method should return some kind of `Set` that iterates the keys in order; that is, in increasing order according to the `compareTo` method.  There are several ways to do that, but the simplest is to return an implementation of `Set` that maintains the order of the elements.  The most commonly-used implementations, like `HashSet`, don't have this property, but Java provides one that does: `LinkedHashSet`.

We provide an outline of `keySet` that creates and returns a `LinkedHashSet`:

```java
	public Set<K> keySet() {
		Set<K> set = new LinkedHashSet<K>();
		return set;
	}
```

You should finish off this method so it adds the keys from the tree to `set` in ascending order.  Hint: you might want to write a helper method, you might want to make it recursive, and you might want to [read about in-order tree traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order).

When you are done, all tests should pass.  In the next README, we'll go over our solutions and test the performance of the core methods.
